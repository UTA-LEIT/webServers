# Web Socket Servers
> Comunication through sockets from AR

The project contains two examples of http socket servers one multithreaded and one singlethreaded, two examples of html files located in the root of the folder
that you can call in the browser uppon after starting the server. Project also contains server/client multithreaded socket comunication.

## Usage example

This is  simply a boilerplate code for http/socket servers using python that can be expanded at will.

## Development setup
* http server(Multithreaded or singlethreaded)
      * Download the httpServer_multithread.py file, and the html files
      * Keep all files in the same directory
      * if using in the same machine, keep the server IP as 0.0.0.0
      * if using in different machines, change the ip to the hostmachine ip
      * im using port 8080 but you are free to choose any port
      * access files in the browser using {ipaddress}:{port}/filename.html
* Socket Server/client
      * Download client_multithreading_b.py and multithread_server_b.py
      * If using in the same machine, keep the server IP as 0.0.0.0
      * If using in different machines, change the ip to the hostmachine's ip
      * Run server
